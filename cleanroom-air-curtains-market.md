<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cleanroom Air Curtains Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Recirculating Air Curtains</li><li>Non-recirculating Air Curtains</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Cleanroom Air Curtains market is divided into two primary types: recirculating and non-recirculating air curtains. Recirculating air curtains draw air from the cleanroom environment, filter it, and reintroduce it, maintaining optimal air quality while minimizing energy consumption. In contrast, non-recirculating air curtains draw in external air, which may be treated, and direct it into the cleanroom, usually providing a higher level of air turnover but requiring more energy for air conditioning. Both types serve to maintain air cleanliness and temperature control in critical environments.</p></p>
